# This is the vimchat config file. Note that while vimchat is running, you can
# edit and write this file and vimchat will update itself on the fly.
#
# Accounts entries are in the form: username@server/resource = password.
# The '/resource' part of the account is optional.  It is a jabber feature that
# lets you associate physical locations with your accounts.  The password is
# optional as well.  If you leave the password blank, vimchat will prompt you
# for it when you connect. These accounts will be connected to automatically
# when vimchat starts.  You may connect or disconnect from a particular account
# with \on and \off.
