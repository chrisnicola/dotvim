============================================================================

*INSTALL*

Download vimpress_2.x.x.zip, extract it in your .vim directory:

  cd ~/.vim
  unzip /path/to/vimpress_2.x.x.zip

*CONFIGURE*

Edit ~/.vimrc , add a variable named VIMPRESS. Multiple blog configurations are supported.

Example:

let VIMPRESS = [{'username':'user',
                \'password':'pass',
                \'blog_url':'http://your-first-blog.com/'
                \},
                \{'username':'user',
                \'blog_url':'http://your-second-blog.com/'
                \}]

Hardcoding the password is optional. If a password is not provided the plugin
will prompt for one the first time it's needed.

If you need Markdown support, simply run `sudo apt-get install python-markdown' in Ubuntu.
